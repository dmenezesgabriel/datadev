### Feature Attribution Drift

Feature attribution drift is a specific type of model drift that occurs when the importance of features used by a machine learning model changes over time. This can happen due to changes in the underlying data distribution, changes in the relationships between features and the target variable, or changes in the model itself.

- NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain) is a common metric used to measure feature attribution drift. It compares the importance of features in the current model to the importance of features in a reference model, and provides a score that indicates how much the feature importance has changed.
