# Normalization and Scaling

Transform numerical features to a common scale without distorting differences in the ranges of values.

- Normalization (Min-Max Scaling): Scales features to a fixed range, typically [0, 1], by subtracting the minimum value and dividing by the range of the feature.
- Standardization (Z-Score Scaling): Transforms features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.
