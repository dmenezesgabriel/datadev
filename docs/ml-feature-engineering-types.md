# Feature engineering Types

## Feature Creation (Encoding, Binning)

Refers to the creation of new features from existing data to help with better predictions.

Examples:

- one-hot-encoding
- binning
- splitting
- calculated features

## Feature Transformation and imputation

Include steps for replacing missing features or features that are not valid.

## Feature Extraction (PCA, LDA)

Involves reducing the amount of data to be processed using dimensionality reduction techniques, reducing the amount of memory and computing power required while still maintaining the original data characteristics.

Examples:

- PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
- LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis)
- IDA (Independent Component Analysis)

## Feature Selection

Is the process of selecting a subset of extracted features.

Examples:

- Feature importance score
- Correlation matrix
